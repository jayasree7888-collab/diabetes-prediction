ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on 8 key medical diagnostic features.
It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle
 / UCI Machine Learning Repository.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:

Data Cleaning

Handling impossible zero-values (e.g., Glucose, BMI) by replacing them with the median.

Data Preprocessing

Scaling features using StandardScaler for optimal model performance.

Model Training

Implementing and comparing three classification models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Model Evaluation

Evaluating models using Accuracy and ROC-AUC Score.

Model Tuning

Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the top-performing model (Random Forest).

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Python 3

pandas â†’ Data loading and manipulation

NumPy â†’ Numerical operations and handling NaN values

scikit-learn â†’ For:

SimpleImputer â†’ Data cleaning

StandardScaler â†’ Feature scaling

train_test_split â†’ Data splitting

LogisticRegression, SVC, RandomForestClassifier â†’ Models

accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, classification_report â†’ Evaluation

GridSearchCV â†’ Hyperparameter tuning

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone the repository or download the files.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


Place the dataset (diabetes.csv) in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:

python diabetes_prediction.py


The script will execute all steps â€” from data loading and cleaning to model training and tuning â€” and print the evaluation results in the terminal.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Model	Accuracy	ROC-AUC Score
Logistic Regression	0.7532	0.8230
Random Forest	0.7403	0.8334
SVM	0.7468	0.8072

The Random Forest model achieved the best baseline ROC-AUC score.

ðŸ”§ After Hyperparameter Tuning

Tuned Random Forest ROC-AUC: 0.8404

Best Parameters Found:

{'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_leaf': 4, 'n_estimators': 300}

ðŸ§  Key Takeaway

This project highlights the effectiveness of data preprocessing, model comparison, and hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance for medical diagnostic predictions.
